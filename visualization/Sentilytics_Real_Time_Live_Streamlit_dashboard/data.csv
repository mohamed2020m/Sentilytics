I can tell you this, from what I suspect he can't  and never will be charged with anything again in any court of law. He is unfit to stand any trials because of serious medical issues. His diagnosis, if correct and finally revealed, puts a total different light on the whole story of sexual abuse. It actually might happen in much bigger scale than we know now OR it might actually NOT happen at all. He might even don't have so many lovers for real as he let us believe for a while.","youtube","0","positive"

It is a crime to punish a man who is innocent of those accusations.  He clearly loves everything about his work, the process of acting amd the wonderful memories.  worked for  The American Film Institute/The Kennedy Center Honors; I was awesteuck at being in the same elevator as Douglas Fairbanks, Jr & Jimmy Stewart; with all their film characters swirling around in my head.  Watching a film with Kevin Spacey is like curling up with a great a book. He's a consumate  storyteller whether as actor or narrating his own  tragic story.            \n  A similar thing is going on in Great Britain where actors and everyday people are being silenced and imprisoned for standing up for their freedom of speach.\n  I  think a touring company of actors who've been ostracized would be a great success.  The recent US election has proven  that every day people are sick to death of Cancel Culture.\n  Thank you, again, for giving us some time with this beautiful man .\n  Hope to see him treading the boards or on the screen, very soon.","youtube","1","positive"
